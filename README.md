Repository for my PhD dissertation proposal written in R Markdown. Copywrite 2022, Thomas W. Jones

The format for this dissertation is modified from Tyler Bradley's "dragondown" package, a template for dissertations at Drexel University, https://github.com/tbradley1013/dragondown. Many thanks.

To run this dissertation, do the following:

1. Run all scripts in R/ in order as indicated by folder and file numbers
2. Open index.Rmd in RStudio and click "knit". (There is a command line equivalent but it escapes me)
3. Retrieve the completed dissertation from _book/thesis.pdf or _book/thesis.tex as is your preference

Note that running all the scripts in R/ will produce a lot of non-trivial computations. On my high-powered desktop (i9 processor with 24 virtual cores and 128GB of RAM) it takes just over a week of compute time to run everything end to end. If you're trying to do this on a laptop, God help you.
